 YouTube Video Downloader with Custom Download Folder using Pytube
This Python script utilizes the `pytube` library to download YouTube videos and allows users to specify a custom download folder.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `pytube` library (Install using `pip install pytube`)

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `pip install pytube`.
3. Replace `'youtube_video_url'` in the script with the URL of the YouTube video you want to download.
4. Replace `'your_download_folder'` with the desired folder path to save the video.

The script will create the specified download folder (if it doesn't exist) and save the video as 'downloaded_video.mp4' within that directory.

## Important Note
